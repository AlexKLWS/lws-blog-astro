Hi there! My name is Alex. I am applying for the **Senior Frontend Engineer (React), Growth** position. I had a little bit of free time, so I have built a small project I to showcase my skills. I'd love it if you could take a moment to check it out, along with the code. I believe my experience would be a great fit for the role, and I hope this project demonstrates that.

A bit about me: I have over 9 years of software development and leadership experience. I've been involved in everything from hiring and mentoring to designing code architecture and high-level planning. I learn quickly and adapt to any situation. If something needs to be done I roll up my sleeves and do it. No matter if it’s a unfamiliar codebase or tech-stack, I always get things done.

Actions speak louder than words, so I hope this project gives you a good sense of my speed and ability to handle complex full-stack projects. Thank you very much for your time!

You can test the deployed project here: https://creative-fabrica-test.vercel.app

And view the source code here: https://github.com/AlexKLWS/creative-fabrica-test

An important note: due to the fact that I am using some advanced, cutting-edge React and Nextjs features such as RSC and Suspense, I've encountered issues described here when writing tests: https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/issues/1209 , so I had to upgrade the react and react-dom dependencies to version 19 RC, and react-three/fiber to version 9 alpha. However, this introduced a conflict with Storybook's and react-three/drei's dependencies. As a workaround, you’ll need to run npm install with the --force flag. Despite these changes, the project builds and runs perfectly. However, the Storybook doesn't work due to the issue described here: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/29380

Now, the details...

### The Project

The idea for this project is simple – I wanted to build a small full-stack app to demonstrate my knowledge of the tech stack described in the job posting. What I ended up with is a small website inspired by Creative Fabrica's platform. It allows users to view available products and bookmark them.

The app starts with a login page where you only need to enter a username. If you enter a new, unique username, it creates a new user; if you use an existing username, it logs you in as that user. It's like a typical username and password login, but without the password. While this isn't secure, it's not a concern for this project.
<ZoomableImage url={myImage1} alt={'Simplified login page'}/>
After logging in, you'll see a list of mock products available for purchase, fetched from the remote database. In the top right corner of each card there’s a bookmark button, clicking on which marks the are as bookmarked for your user. Next time you login as the same user, from any device, your choice will be preserved, as data is stored in the remote database.
<ZoomableImage url={myImage2} alt={'List of products'}/>
The app is also fully responsive, and looks as good on mobile screens as it does on desktop.
<ZoomableImage url={myImage3} alt={'Mobile UI'}/>
And this is about all there’s to it!

### The Development

For the frontend, I chose Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind, which I consider the default go-to stack for modern web development. I'm familiar with the latest Next.js features, so I used the app router and server actions for requests. To speed up UI development, I used the shadcn/ui library. The frontend is pretty simple: when a user logs in, their username is stored in a cookie and sent to the backend as a header.

However, I wanted to challenge myself and make the project more interesting. I implemented a snap carousel component from scratch using ref forwarding. Additionally, I decided to use a technology I am not very familiar with to demonstrate my ability to quickly pick up new skills. I chose Three.js, which I had been wanting to learn better for a while now. Although I have a strong background in 3D, I haven’t had many opportunities to use Three.js throughout my career.

Since the job posting mentioned knowledge of MySQL and AWS, I incorporated them into my backend stack. The MySQL database is hosted on AWS RDS, and I used Node.js Lambdas for backend logic, deployed via AWS SAM. While the project isn’t overly complex, I used some advanced techniques to showcase my solid understanding of the technologies involved.

The project also includes a very thorough test suite covering some of the most important aspects of the website.
