### Steam Capsule
A challenging FPS that fuses classic shooter design with arcade-style scoring and ranking systems. Master fast, brutal combat and outsmart deadly enemies while uncovering a hard sci-fi mystery aboard the migrant ship Ziusudra’s Ark.

### Long Pitch
The game is a challenging, deeply engaging FPS that blends classic shooter design – drawing inspiration from the original Marathon trilogy and, to a degree, Doom – with arcade-driven systems such as a Battle Garegga-inspired dynamic ranking mechanic and a robust scoring system that rewards strategy, precision and mastery.
At its core, the gameplay is built around organic enemy synergy and carefully crafted encounter design. The primary source of tension and engagement comes not from superficial player mechanics, but from enemy and encounter design.
You control the body of a cyborg aboard the migrant ship Ziusudra’s Ark, activated to eliminate the scavenger bots tearing the vessel apart. Once home to several million people, the ship now stands eerily silent and seemingly abandoned. As you fight to to push back the scavenger threat, you must also piece together what happened to its vanished population.
This is not a game designed for addiction loops or artificial compulsion. It is built around challenge, focus, and reward — a game about skill and mastery. The same philosophy guides its narrative. The story is an experiment: an attempt to push philosophical, historical, and scientific ideas as far as possible without losing coherence, inviting players to engage with concepts that are ambitious, unsettling, and intellectually demanding.
